\section{Introduction}\label{intro}
In the introduction, the main material is usually text, references and lists. Note that we label sections in case we want to refer to them. See the tex command where we declare a section called Introduction. After this, you see that we also define a label for this section. The contents of this file are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item We give the outline of a file with different sections and sub-sections. 
\item We also include an example of a list of bullet items.
\end{itemize}

\section{Analysis}\label{analysis}
The section on analysis is split into two sub-sections. 

\subsection{Analysis: Part 1}\label{analysis1}
Here is the first part.

\subsection{Analysis: Part 2}\label{analysis2}
Here is the second part where we refer back to Sec. \ref{analysis1}.

\section{Numerical Results}\label{NumRes}
 Here, you often discuss the mathematics and any results using tables, graphics, etc. Perhaps you refer back to a previous section such as Sec. \ref{intro} for some reason.
 
 \section{Conclusions}\label{Conc}
